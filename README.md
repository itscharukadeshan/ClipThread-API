# Clip Thread API

## What is Clip-thread API?

Clip thread API allows users to create and manage collections of clips.

- Basic CRUD operation to create and manage threads.
- Expanded moderation control for streamers and moderators.
- Built in default content moderation.

## DOCS

### Swagger UI

Our API is documented using Swagger/OpenAPI. You can view and interact with the API documentation at:

    /docs

### Postman Collection

We also provide a Postman collection for easier testing and integration:

1. Open Postman
2. Click on "Import" in the upper left corner
3. Select the "Link" tab
4. Enter the following URL: [/docs.json]
5. Click "Continue" and then "Import"

This will create a new collection in Postman with all our API endpoints. For more detailed instructions on importing Swagger docs into Postman, visit: [Postman's official guide on importing from Swagger](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-from-swagger/).
